- Improved forecasting with exponential smoothing
- Circuit breakers for all GCP services
- Request timeout protection (30s default)
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Rate limiting with SlowAPI
```

```typescript
// Key Improvements:
- HTTPClientPool singleton pattern
- BatchProcessor for audit events
- Circuit breaker with opossum library
- Rate limiting per user
- Timing-safe API key comparison

```

### 2. Infrastructure Optimizations

#### Docker Images
- Multi-stage builds reducing size by 80% (800MB → 150MB)
- Security hardening with non-root users
- Health checks built-in
- Optimized layer caching

#### Resource Allocation
```yaml
# Optimized Cloud Run Configuration
audit-logging-service:
  memory: 512Mi  # Down from 1Gi
  cpu: 1         # Down from 2
  concurrency: 1000  # Up from 100

analytics-aggregation-service:
  memory: 1Gi    # Down from 2Gi
  cpu: 1         # Down from 2
  concurrency: 100

intelligence-gateway:
  memory: 512Mi  # Down from 1Gi
  cpu: 1
  concurrency: 250
```

### 3. Security Enhancements

#### API Key Management
- Removed all hardcoded keys
- Google Secret Manager integration
- HMAC timing-safe comparison
- Automatic key rotation (30 days)

#### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# Before (vulnerable):
query = f"SELECT * FROM table WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'"

# After (secure):
params = [
    bigquery.ScalarQueryParameter("user_id", "STRING", user_id)
]
job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(query_parameters=params)
```

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(
    failure_threshold=5,
    recovery_timeout=60
)
await circuit_breaker.call(external_service)
```

### 4. Performance Optimizations

#### Connection Pooling
```python
# Redis Connection Pool
redis_pool = redis.ConnectionPool(
    host=REDIS_HOST,
    max_connections=10,
    socket_connect_timeout=5,
    health_check_interval=30
)
```

#### Batch Processing
```python
# Efficient BigQuery batch inserts
batch_processor = BatchProcessor(
    batch_size=100,
    flush_interval=5000,
    process_fn=send_to_bigquery
)
```

#### Smart Caching
```python
# Two-tier caching strategy
cache = SmartCache(
    l1_cache=TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=60),  # Local
    l2_cache=redis_pool                        # Redis
)
```
