## Why These Files Were Archived

These files were moved to the archive for the following reasons:

1. **Phase Reports**: Represent completed work phases. Historical value for reference, but not needed for active development.

2. **Planning Documents**: Initial planning and roadmaps that have been executed. Useful for understanding design decisions but not current development guides.

3. **Deployment Scripts**: One-time setup scripts that were executed during initial platform deployment. Not needed for ongoing operations but preserved for disaster recovery scenarios.

4. **Migration Utilities**: One-time migration scripts used during platform evolution. Not applicable to new deployments but useful for understanding historical changes.

5. **Templates**: Superseded by actual implementations or integrated into active services.

6. **TRD Documents**: Technical requirement documents that have been fully implemented as services. The implementations themselves are now the source of truth.

## When to Reference Archived Files

You might need to reference these archived files when:

- **Understanding Historical Decisions**: Why certain architectural choices were made
- **Disaster Recovery**: Reconstructing infrastructure from scratch
- **Audit & Compliance**: Reviewing security improvements and optimization phases
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Onboarding new team members to understand platform evolution
- **Similar Implementations**: Using past deployment scripts as templates for new services

## Active Documentation

For current platform documentation, see:

- **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Main project documentation
- **[../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - AI assistant development guidance
- **[../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Current architecture
- **[../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Current deployment procedures
- **[../SECURITY_FIXES.md](../SECURITY_FIXES.md)** - Active security guidelines
- **[../COST_OPTIMIZATION_TRACKING.md](../COST_OPTIMIZATION_TRACKING.md)** - Cost monitoring

## Archive Maintenance

This archive is organized for easy reference but should not be modified unless:

1. Adding new completed phase reports
2. Moving additional deprecated files from the main repository
3. Updating this README to reflect archive additions

Do not delete files from the archive without team consensus, as they represent the platform's historical development context.
