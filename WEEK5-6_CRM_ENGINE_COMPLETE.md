## KEY FEATURES

### 1. Unified Contact Model

Supports both **people** and **companies** with rich metadata:
- Personal contacts with company affiliations
- Company profiles with industry/size
- Social links (Slack, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Source tracking (how contact was discovered)
- Relationship classification
- Interaction history with counts

### 2. Interaction Tracking

Captures all communication across channels:
- **Email** - Inbox/outbox, threads
- **Slack** - Messages, mentions, reactions
- **Meetings** - Calendar events
- **Phone calls** - Duration, notes
- **Manual notes** - User annotations

Auto-increments interaction counts on contacts.

### 3. Search & Filtering

Flexible contact search with multiple filters:
- Text search (name, email, company)
- Filter by type (person/company)
- Filter by relationship type
- Filter by status (active/inactive/archived)
- Filter by owner
- Pagination (limit/offset)

### 4. Notes & Tasks

User-created annotations:
- **Notes** - Free-form text, tags, pinning
- **Tasks** - Title, description, due date, priority
- **Authorship** - Track who created what
- **Status tracking** - Pending → In Progress → Completed

### 5. Statistics & Analytics

Real-time CRM insights:
```json
{
  "totalContacts": 145,
  "people": 98,
  "companies": 47,
  "byRelationshipType": {
    "customer": 67,
    "prospect": 45,
    "partner": 23,
    "vendor": 10
  },
  "bySource": {
    "slack": 89,
    "gmail": 34,
    "manual": 22
  }
}
```

## INTEGRATION READY

### Slack Integration
```typescript
// When Slack message received
await crmService.findOrCreateContactByEmail(
  tenantId, userId, userEmail,
  slackUser.email,
  slackUser.real_name,
  'slack'
);

await crmService.createInteraction(tenantId, {
  contactId,
  type: InteractionType.SLACK_MESSAGE,
  direction: InteractionDirection.INBOUND,
  content: message.text,
  externalId: message.ts,
  sourceService: 'slack',
  channelId: message.channel,
});
```

### Gmail Integration (Ready for Week 7-8)
```typescript
// When email received
await crmService.findOrCreateContactByEmail(
  tenantId, userId, userEmail,
  fromEmail,
  fromName,
  'gmail'
);

await crmService.createInteraction(tenantId, {
  contactId,
  type: InteractionType.EMAIL,
  direction: InteractionDirection.INBOUND,
  subject: email.subject,
  content: email.body,
  externalId: email.messageId,

## ERRORS FIXED

### Error: Firestore Initialization
**Issue:** `getFirestore()` called at class initialization before Firebase was ready
**Fix:** Changed to getter method `private get db() { return getFirestore(); }`
**Impact:** Service now initializes correctly

1. Create Gmail service with Google OAuth
2. Fetch inbox/sent emails
3. Parse email threads and participants

5. Create interactions for each email
6. Add Gmail routes to Intelligence Gateway

### Enhancements
- Task management UI
- Contact deduplication
- AI-powered contact enrichment
- Relationship insights
- Communication patterns analysis
