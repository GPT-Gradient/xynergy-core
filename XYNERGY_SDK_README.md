```

## Usage Examples

### Real-time Dashboard

```python
async with XynergyPlatformSDK(api_key) as sdk:
    # Subscribe to events
    def on_update(event):
        if event['type'] == 'workflow_update':
            print(f"Workflow {event['workflow_id']}: {event['status']}")

    sdk.subscribe_to_events(on_update)
    await sdk.connect_websocket()

    # Get dashboard data
    overview = await sdk.get_dashboard_overview()
    print(f"Active Workflows: {overview.active_workflows}")
    print(f"Cost Savings: {overview.cost_metrics.cost_savings_percentage}%")
```

### Workflow Orchestration

```python
# Execute business intent
workflow = await sdk.execute_business_intent(
    intent="Create comprehensive marketing campaign",
    context={
        "company": "EcoFashion Co",
        "budget": "$25,000",
        "timeline": "Q2 2025"
    }
)

# Monitor progress
while workflow.status in [WorkflowStatus.PENDING, WorkflowStatus.EXECUTING]:
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    workflow = await sdk.get_workflow_status(workflow.workflow_id)
    print(f"Progress: {workflow.progress:.1%}")
```

### Custom Workflow Creation

```python
# Define workflow with dependencies
steps = [
    {
        "step_id": "market_research",
        "service": "marketing-engine",
        "action": "analyze_market",
        "parameters": {"business_type": "SaaS"}
    },
    {
        "step_id": "content_strategy",
        "service": "content-hub",
        "action": "create_strategy",
        "depends_on": ["market_research"]
    }
]

workflow = await sdk.create_workflow("Marketing Launch", steps)
```

### Service Integration

```python
# Direct service calls
campaign = await sdk.call_service(
    service_name="marketing-engine",
    endpoint="/api/generate-campaign",
    method="POST",
    payload={
        "business_type": "E-commerce",
        "target_audience": "millennials",
        "budget_range": "$10,000-$50,000"
    }
)

# Standardized service actions
result = await sdk.execute_service_action(
    service_name="ai-routing-engine",
    action="route_request",
    parameters={
        "query": "Generate marketing content",
        "preferred_provider": "abacus"
    }
)
```

## Error Handling

### Circuit Breaker Management

```python
try:
    result = await sdk.execute_business_intent("Generate campaign")
except Exception as e:
    # Check circuit breaker status
    breakers = await sdk.get_circuit_breaker_status()
    for service, states in breakers.items():
        for breaker, status in states.items():
            if status["state"] == "OPEN":
                print(f"Circuit breaker open: {service}.{breaker}")
                # Implement fallback logic
```

### Service Unavailability

```python
# Check service health before operations
health = await sdk.get_platform_health()
if health.overall_status != ServiceStatus.HEALTHY:
    print(f"Platform issues: {health.unhealthy_services}")
    # Implement graceful degradation
```
