## ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-Q1
**Deciders:** CTO, Lead Architect, Platform Team

### Context

We need to build a platform that supports multiple business domains (marketing, SEO, analytics, AI) with:
- Independent deployment cycles
- Different scaling requirements per domain
- Team autonomy
- Technology flexibility
- Fault isolation

### Decision

Adopt a microservices architecture with 40+ independent services, each responsible for a single business capability.

**Key Principles:**
- Single Responsibility Principle per service
- Decentralized data management
- Independent deployability
- API-first design
- Event-driven communication

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Independent scaling (ASO engine scales differently than dashboard)
- ✅ Technology flexibility (can use different databases per service if needed)
- ✅ Fault isolation (one service failure doesn't crash entire platform)
- ✅ Faster deployment (deploy one service without affecting others)
- ✅ Team autonomy (teams own their services end-to-end)

**Negative:**
- ❌ Increased operational complexity (44 services to manage)
- ❌ Distributed system challenges (network latency, partial failures)
- ❌ More complex testing (integration testing across services)
- ❌ Service discovery and routing overhead

**Mitigations:**
- Shared infrastructure modules to reduce code duplication
- Standardized deployment patterns (Terraform, Cloud Run)
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### Alternatives Considered

**Monolithic Architecture:**
- ❌ Rejected: Wouldn't support independent scaling and deployment
- ❌ Team conflicts as codebase grows
- ❌ Technology lock-in

**Modular Monolith:**
- ⚠️ Considered but rejected
- ✅ Simpler operationally
- ❌ Still couples deployment cycles
- ❌ Cannot scale components independently

- Document migration path to other clouds (contingency)

### Alternatives Considered

**AWS:**
- ✅ Market leader, mature ecosystem
- ❌ More expensive for our use case
- ❌ Steeper learning curve
- ❌ Lambda cold starts longer than Cloud Run

**Azure:**
- ✅ Good enterprise integration
- ❌ Less compelling for startups
- ❌ Weaker data analytics offerings
- ❌ Team has less expertise

**Multi-Cloud:**
- ❌ Rejected: Too complex for current scale

- Good performance
- Modern developer experience

### Decision

Use FastAPI as the standard web framework for all services.

**Features Used:**
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Pydantic for request/response validation
- Dependency injection for auth, rate limiting
- ASGI server (uvicorn) for async support
- CORS middleware

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Excellent performance (comparable to Node.js, Go)
- ✅ Automatic API documentation (Swagger UI)
- ✅ Type hints catch errors at development time
- ✅ Async/await for high concurrency
- ✅ Growing community and ecosystem

**Negative:**

## ADR-004: Polyglot Persistence

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-Q1
**Deciders:** Lead Architect, Data Team

### Context

Different data access patterns require different database types:
- **Transactional**: Real-time reads/writes (campaigns, sessions)
- **Analytical**: Historical analysis, reporting (metrics, trends)
- **Caching**: Hot data, temporary state
- **Blob Storage**: Files, reports, media

Using a single database for all patterns leads to suboptimal performance and cost.

### Decision

Use polyglot persistence with specialized databases:

1. **Firestore**: Transactional, real-time data
2. **BigQuery**: Analytical, data warehouse
3. **Redis**: Caching, session storage
4. **Cloud Storage**: Blob storage

**Data Flow:**
```
Write → Firestore → Event → BigQuery (eventually consistent)
Read → Redis (cached) → BigQuery → Response
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Optimal performance for each use case
- ✅ Cost-effective (BigQuery cheaper than transactional DB for analytics)
- ✅ Scalability (each DB scales independently)
- ✅ Right tool for the job

**Negative:**
- ❌ Data synchronization complexity
- ❌ Eventual consistency between stores
- ❌ Multiple databases to manage
- ❌ More complex backup/restore

**Mitigations:**
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- Clear ownership: which DB is source of truth for what data
- Automated sync via Pub/Sub events
- Shared GCP client manager

### Alternatives Considered

**Single Database (PostgreSQL):**
- ❌ Poor performance for analytics at scale
- ❌ Expensive to scale for analytical queries
- ✅ Simpler data model

**NoSQL Only (Firestore):**
- ❌ Not optimized for analytical queries
- ❌ Expensive for large scans
- ✅ Simpler architecture

## ADR-005: Pub/Sub Event Bus

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-Q2
**Deciders:** Lead Architect, Platform Team

### Context

Services need to communicate asynchronously for:
- Decoupling (service A doesn't depend on service B being up)
- Event broadcasting (one event, multiple subscribers)
- Guaranteed delivery
- Replay capability

### Decision

Use Google Cloud Pub/Sub as the primary event bus for asynchronous communication.

**Pattern:**
- One topic per service: `{service-name}-events`
- Domain topics: `trend-identified`, `validation-complete`
- Subscriptions with dead letter queues
- 7-day message retention for replay

**Message Format:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "campaign_created",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "payload": {...},
  "metadata": {
    "correlation_id": "request_id"
  }
}
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ At-least-once delivery guarantee
- ✅ Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- ✅ Decoupled services (loose coupling)
- ✅ Event replay for 7 days
- ✅ Scalable (handles millions of messages/sec)

**Negative:**
- ❌ Eventual consistency (not immediate)
- ❌ Message ordering not guaranteed (without ordering keys)
- ❌ Debugging distributed flows harder

**Mitigations:**
- Correlation IDs for tracing
- Idempotent event handlers
- Dead letter queues for poison messages
- Clear event schemas

### Alternatives Considered

**Apache Kafka:**
- ✅ Better ordering guarantees
- ✅ Higher throughput
- ❌ More complex to operate
- ❌ Higher cost (need to run clusters)
- ❌ Team has less expertise

**RabbitMQ:**
- ✅ Feature-rich, mature
- ❌ Need to manage infrastructure
- ❌ Lower throughput than Pub/Sub

**Direct HTTP:**
- ✅ Simple, synchronous
- ❌ Tight coupling
- ❌ No built-in retry
- ❌ Cascading failures

## ADR-006: Redis Caching Layer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-Q2
**Deciders:** Performance Team, Platform Team

### Context

Many queries are repeated frequently (stats, content lists) and don't change rapidly. Database queries are expensive:
- BigQuery: $5 per TB scanned
- Latency: 250-550ms uncached

Caching can dramatically improve:
- Performance (sub-10ms response)
- Cost (reduce BigQuery queries)
- User experience

### Decision

Implement Redis (Memorystore) as a caching layer with:
- Category-based TTLs (5 minutes to 1 hour)
- Cache-aside pattern
- Connection pooling (max 20 connections)
- Namespaced keys for isolation

**Cache Strategy:**
```
Check cache → Hit: Return (< 10ms)
           → Miss: Query DB → Store in cache → Return
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ 96-98% faster responses (cached)
- ✅ 84%+ cache hit rate achieved
- ✅ $456/month cost savings on BigQuery
- ✅ Better user experience

**Negative:**
- ❌ Cache invalidation complexity
- ❌ Stale data risk (eventual consistency)
- ❌ Additional infrastructure to manage
- ❌ Cold cache performance (cache miss)

**Mitigations:**
- Appropriate TTLs per data type
- Cache warming for critical data
- Monitoring cache hit rates
- Fallback to database always works

### Alternatives Considered

**No Caching:**
- ❌ Unacceptable latency
- ❌ High cost
- ✅ Simpler (no cache invalidation)

**In-Memory (Local):**
- ❌ Not shared across instances
- ❌ Lost on container restart
- ✅ Slightly faster

**CDN Caching:**
- ✅ Good for static content
- ❌ Not suitable for dynamic, personalized data

## ADR-007: AI Routing Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-Q3
**Deciders:** CTO, AI Team, Finance

### Context

AI costs are a major expense:
- OpenAI: $0.025 per request
- Abacus AI: $0.015 per request
- Internal AI (self-hosted): $0.001 per request

At scale (1M requests/month):
- All OpenAI: $25,000/month
- Optimized routing: $2,750/month (89% savings)

Need to balance:
- Cost efficiency
- Quality/accuracy
- Reliability

### Decision

Implement intelligent AI routing strategy:

**Routing Logic:**
```
Request → Complexity Analysis
    ↓
Complex (research, current events)?
    → Try Abacus AI ($0.015)
    → Fallback to OpenAI ($0.025)

Simple (factual, straightforward)?
    → Internal AI ($0.001)
```

**Complexity Indicators:**
- Keywords: "current", "latest", "today", "news", "research"
- Length: > 500 characters
- Multi-step reasoning required

**Fallback Chain:**
```
Abacus AI (primary)
    ↓ (if unavailable)
OpenAI (secondary)
    ↓ (if unavailable)
Internal AI (final fallback)
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ 89% cost reduction vs pure OpenAI
- ✅ Quality maintained for complex queries
- ✅ Reliability through fallback chain
- ✅ Internal AI handles 78% of queries

**Negative:**
- ❌ Routing logic adds complexity
- ❌ Misclassification risk (complex → internal = poor quality)
- ❌ Latency added by routing decision
- ❌ Multiple API keys to manage

**Mitigations:**
- Continuous monitoring of quality metrics
- Manual review of misclassified queries
- Caching AI responses (1-hour TTL)
- Circuit breakers for each provider

### Alternatives Considered

**Single Provider (OpenAI):**
- ❌ Cost too high at scale
- ✅ Simplest to implement
- ✅ Consistent quality

**All Internal AI:**
- ✅ Lowest cost
- ❌ Lower quality for complex queries
- ❌ Cannot handle current events

**No Routing (Random):**
- ❌ No cost optimization
- ❌ Unpredictable costs

## ADR-008: Multi-Tenant Isolation

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-Q3
**Deciders:** Lead Architect, Security Team

### Context

Platform serves multiple clients (tenants) who must not:
- Access each other's data
- Impact each other's performance
- Share resources unsafely

Need to decide between:
- **Database per tenant** (complete isolation)
- **Schema per tenant** (logical isolation)
- **Shared schema** (row-level isolation)

### Decision

Use **Hybrid Approach**:

**Shared Schema (Firestore):**
- All tenants in same collections
- Tenant ID as first field
- Security rules enforce isolation
- Cost-effective for operational data

**Isolated Datasets (BigQuery):**
- Per-tenant datasets: `aso_tenant_{tenant_id}`
- Complete data isolation
- Independent billing
- GDPR/CCPA compliance easier

**Tenant Context Propagation:**
```
HTTP Request
    ↓ Header: X-Tenant-ID
Service A
    ↓ Propagate tenant_id
Query: WHERE tenant_id = @tenant_id
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Cost efficiency (shared Firestore)
- ✅ Data sovereignty (isolated BigQuery)
- ✅ Flexible scaling per tenant
- ✅ Security through multiple layers
- ✅ Compliance (can delete all tenant data easily)

**Negative:**
- ❌ Two different isolation models
- ❌ More complex queries (always filter by tenant_id)
- ❌ Risk of tenant_id bugs (data leakage)
- ❌ BigQuery costs scale with tenants

**Mitigations:**
- Automated tests for tenant isolation
- Security rules in Firestore
- Code review for all queries
- Tenant context middleware

### Alternatives Considered

**Database Per Tenant:**
- ✅ Complete isolation
- ❌ High cost (N databases)
- ❌ Management complexity
- ❌ Doesn't scale to 1000s of tenants

**Pure Shared Schema:**
- ✅ Lowest cost
- ❌ Higher security risk
- ❌ Noisy neighbor problems
- ❌ Harder GDPR compliance

## ADR-009: Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-Q4
**Deciders:** Reliability Team, Platform Team

### Context

Distributed systems experience failures:
- Network timeouts
- Service unavailability
- Cascading failures (service A → service B → service C all fail)

Need to:
- Prevent cascading failures
- Provide graceful degradation
- Give failing services time to recover

### Decision

Implement Circuit Breaker pattern for all external calls:

**States:**
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests flow through
- **OPEN**: Too many failures, block requests, return fallback
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing recovery, allow 1 request

**Configuration:**
```python
CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=5,     # Open after 5 failures
    timeout=60,              # Wait 60s before retry
    expected_exception=Exception
)
```

**State Transitions:**
```
CLOSED --(5 failures)--> OPEN --(60s)--> HALF_OPEN
                                              |
                                        (success) → CLOSED
                                        (failure) → OPEN
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Prevents cascading failures
- ✅ Faster failure detection (no waiting for timeouts)
- ✅ Gives services time to recover
- ✅ Maintains partial functionality (degraded mode)

**Negative:**
- ❌ Adds complexity to code
- ❌ Can hide underlying issues
- ❌ Configuration tuning needed
- ❌ False positives (opens when shouldn't)

**Mitigations:**
- Monitoring of circuit breaker states
- Alerts when circuits open
- Tunable thresholds per service
- Fallback responses for degraded mode

### Alternatives Considered

**No Circuit Breaker:**
- ❌ Cascading failures
- ❌ Long timeouts pile up
- ✅ Simpler code

**Retry Only:**
- ❌ Doesn't give service time to recover
- ❌ Can make problem worse (thundering herd)
- ✅ Simpler than circuit breaker

**Bulkhead Pattern:**
- ✅ Resource isolation
- ✅ Complementary to circuit breakers
- ❌ More complex (used in addition, not instead)

## ADR-010: BigQuery Partition Pruning

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-Q4
**Deciders:** Data Team, Cost Optimization Team

### Context

BigQuery charges by data scanned:
- $5 per TB scanned
- Full table scans are expensive
- Most queries only need recent data (90 days)

**Problem:**
```sql
-- Scans ALL 730 days of data
SELECT * FROM content_pieces WHERE status = 'active'

Cost: 730 days × 1GB/day = 730GB scanned = $3.65 per query
```

With 40,000 queries/day: **$146,000/month**

### Decision

Implement partition pruning on all time-based queries:

**Pattern:**
```sql
-- Scans only 90 days of data
SELECT * FROM content_pieces
WHERE DATE(created_at) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
  AND status = 'active'

Cost: 90 days × 1GB/day = 90GB scanned = $0.45 per query (87% reduction)
```

**Requirements:**
1. All tables partitioned by DATE(timestamp_column)
2. Partition filter BEFORE other filters
3. Use parameterized queries
4. Add `days_back` parameter to APIs

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ 70-90% cost reduction on queries
- ✅ Faster query performance (less data scanned)
- ✅ $456/month immediate savings
- ✅ Scales linearly with data growth

**Negative:**
- ❌ API changes required (add days_back parameter)
- ❌ Cannot easily query old data (> partition limit)
- ❌ Migration effort for existing tables
- ❌ Developers must remember to use partition filter

**Mitigations:**
- Add linter to check for partition pruning
- Default days_back=90 in APIs
- Documentation and training
- Query examples in code

### Alternatives Considered

**Clustering Only:**
- ✅ Helps with some queries
- ❌ Not as effective as partitioning
- ❌ Still scans too much data

**Materialized Views:**
- ✅ Pre-aggregated data
- ❌ Storage costs
- ❌ Staleness issues
- ✅ Use in addition to partitioning

**No Optimization:**
- ❌ Unacceptable cost
- ✅ Simpler queries

## ADR-011: Connection Pooling Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-Q1
**Deciders:** Performance Team

### Context

Each service creates multiple GCP clients:
- Firestore
- BigQuery
- Pub/Sub
- Cloud Storage

**Without pooling:**
- Cold start: ~15 seconds
- Memory: 200MB per instance
- Connections: New client per request

**Problem:** High cold start latency impacts user experience.

### Decision

Implement singleton pattern for GCP clients:

```python
class GCPClients:
    _instance = None
    _clients = {}

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance

    def get_firestore_client(self):
        if 'firestore' not in self._clients:
            self._clients['firestore'] = firestore.Client()
        return self._clients['firestore']
```

**Shared Module:** `gcp_clients.py` imported by all services

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ 60% reduction in cold start time (15s → 6s)
- ✅ 30% memory savings (reused connections)
- ✅ Consistent client configuration
- ✅ Easier to add retry logic

**Negative:**
- ❌ Shared state (must be thread-safe)
- ❌ Harder to test (need to mock singleton)
- ❌ Connection leaks if not cleaned up

**Mitigations:**
- Thread-safe implementation (RLock)
- Cleanup on shutdown hook
- Connection health checks

### Alternatives Considered

**Client Per Request:**
- ❌ Slow cold starts
- ❌ High memory usage
- ✅ No shared state issues

**Dependency Injection:**
- ✅ More testable
- ❌ More boilerplate
- ❌ Still need pooling underneath

## ADR-012: Token Optimization for AI

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-Q4
**Deciders:** AI Team, Cost Optimization

### Context

AI APIs charge by tokens:
- Input tokens + output tokens
- Longer responses cost more
- Default max_tokens often wasteful

**Example:**
- Simple question: "What is SEO?"
- Default max_tokens: 4096
- Actual needed: ~200
- Wasted cost: 95%

### Decision

Implement dynamic token optimization:

```python
def optimize_tokens(prompt: str, default: int) -> int:
    complexity = analyze_complexity(prompt)

    if complexity == "simple":
        return 500  # Short factual answers
    elif complexity == "medium":
        return 1500  # Moderate explanations
    else:
        return 4096  # Complex analysis
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Prompt length
- Question type (what, how, why, etc.)
- Keywords (research, analysis, detailed)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ 20-30% token reduction
- ✅ Cost savings without quality loss
- ✅ Faster responses (less generation time)
- ✅ Can process more requests/sec

**Negative:**
- ❌ Risk of truncated responses
- ❌ Complexity analysis adds latency
- ❌ Tuning required per use case

**Mitigations:**
- Monitor truncation rates
- Automatic retry with higher tokens if truncated
- A/B testing optimization strategies
- User feedback collection

### Alternatives Considered

**Fixed max_tokens:**
- ❌ Wasteful for simple queries
- ✅ Simple, no complexity
- ❌ No cost optimization

**User-Specified:**
- ✅ User controls cost
- ❌ Poor UX (users don't understand tokens)
- ❌ Requires UI changes

## ADR-013: TypeScript for Intelligence Gateway Services

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** October 2025 (Week 1-8)
**Deciders:** Platform Team, Architecture Team

### Context

The platform requires communication intelligence services (Slack, Gmail, CRM) with:
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- OAuth integration flows
- Rich client libraries (Slack Web API, Google APIs)
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Mock mode for development without credentials

### Decision

Use **TypeScript + Node.js** for Intelligence Gateway services instead of Python/FastAPI.

**Services Affected:**
- XynergyOS Intelligence Gateway (central router)
- Slack Intelligence Service
- Gmail Intelligence Service
- CRM Engine

### Rationale

**TypeScript Advantages:**
1. **Rich Ecosystem**: Mature libraries for Slack (@slack/web-api) and Gmail (googleapis)
2. **WebSocket Native**: Socket.io provides excellent real-time communication
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides strong typing similar to Python's type hints
4. **Performance**: Node.js event loop excellent for I/O-bound communication tasks
5. **Developer Experience**: npm ecosystem, hot reload (tsx), familiar patterns

**Implementation Strategy:**
```
Python Services (21)          TypeScript Services (4)
FastAPI + uvicorn            Express.js + Node.js 20
Pydantic validation          TypeScript interfaces
Redis caching                Redis caching (optional)
Circuit breakers             Circuit breakers
Firestore                    Firestore
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Fast development with excellent client libraries
- ✅ Mock mode pattern allows development without real API credentials
- ✅ WebSocket support out-of-the-box with Socket.io
- ✅ TypeScript provides strong typing and IDE support
- ✅ Large talent pool for TypeScript developers

**Negative:**
- ❌ Introduces second language/ecosystem to platform
- ❌ Separate deployment pipeline for TypeScript services
- ❌ Different monitoring/logging patterns (Winston vs structlog)
- ❌ Team needs to maintain expertise in both Python and TypeScript

**Mitigations:**
1. **Consistent Patterns**: Both use similar architectural patterns (circuit breakers, caching)
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Both deploy to Cloud Run, use Firestore, Firebase Auth
3. **Standard Interfaces**: RESTful APIs with same authentication mechanism
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs for both Python and TypeScript services

### Implementation Details

**Architecture:**
```
Intelligence Gateway (Express.js)
├── Firebase Authentication (same as Python)
├── Rate Limiting (in-memory, similar to Python Redis)
├── Circuit Breaker (TypeScript implementation)
├── Service Router (proxy to backend services)
└── WebSocket (Socket.io for real-time events)
```

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Development
npm install
npm run dev  # Hot reload with tsx

# Production
npm run build  # TypeScript → JavaScript
docker build  # Multi-stage build
gcloud run deploy  # Same as Python services
```

### Alternatives Considered

**1. Python + FastAPI for Everything**
- Rejected: Slack/Gmail libraries less mature in Python
- Rejected: WebSocket support more complex in Python/FastAPI
- Rejected: OAuth flows more documented in Node.js ecosystem

**2. Go for Gateway Services**
- Rejected: Smaller ecosystem for Slack/Gmail SDKs
- Rejected: Longer development time
- Rejected: Team less familiar with Go

**3. Polyglot with Java/Spring**
- Rejected: Too heavyweight for simple API services
- Rejected: Longer cold start times on Cloud Run
- Rejected: Team unfamiliar with Java ecosystem

### Metrics & Validation

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Services deploy successfully to Cloud Run
- ✅ Mock mode works without external API dependencies
- ✅ Circuit breakers protect against failures
- ✅ WebSocket real-time events functional
- ✅ Firebase authentication consistent with Python services
- ✅ Response times <500ms for gateway routing

**Actual Results (Weeks 1-8):**
- All 4 TypeScript services deployed successfully
- Mock mode fully functional for development
- Circuit breakers implemented with 5-failure threshold
- WebSocket events working for Slack/Gmail notifications
- Firebase auth working across all routes
- Gateway routing: 100-300ms (degraded mode without Redis)

### Related Decisions

- **ADR-003** (FastAPI Framework): Remains valid for core platform services
- **ADR-006** (Redis Caching): Applied to Gateway (graceful degradation when unavailable)
- **ADR-009** (Circuit Breaker): Implemented in TypeScript using similar pattern

## ADR-014: Intelligence Gateway Optimization Strategy

**Status:** Accepted and Implemented
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Context:** Intelligence Gateway Phases 1-4 Optimization

### Context & Problem Statement

After deploying the Intelligence Gateway (ADR-013), performance monitoring revealed several optimization opportunities:
- Gateway memory over-allocated (1Gi but using ~200Mi)
- Services over-allocated (512Mi but using ~120Mi)
- Redis connectivity issues (wrong IP configuration)
- No request timeouts or pagination limits
- WebSocket connections unlimited (DoS risk)
- Stack traces exposed in production
- CORS configuration allowing localhost in production
- Debug logging in production increasing costs

**Key Discovery**: Redis was configured with wrong IP (10.0.0.3) instead of actual (10.229.184.219), causing zero cache hit rate.

### Decision

Implement a 4-phase optimization strategy targeting cost, performance, and security:

**Phase 1: Critical Fixes**
- Reduce Gateway memory: 1Gi → 512Mi
- Reduce service memory: 512Mi → 256Mi (Gmail, Slack, CRM)
- Consolidate Redis clients (remove duplicates)
- Add cursor-based pagination (max 100 items)
- Implement HTTP timeouts (30s default, 120s AI)
- Add WebSocket connection limits (5 per user, 1000 total)
- Sanitize production errors (no stack traces)
- Environment-specific CORS (no localhost in production)
- Optimize logging verbosity (info in production)

**Phase 2: Infrastructure**
- Correct Redis IP address (10.229.184.219)
- Enable Serverless VPC Access API
- Create VPC connector for Redis connectivity
- Deploy services with VPC access
- Enable distributed rate limiting

**Phase 3: Performance**
- Enable request/response compression
- Implement AbortController for cancellation
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Remove source maps in production
- Optimize connection pooling

**Phase 4: Monitoring**
- Health checks (basic + deep)
- Redis connectivity monitoring
- WebSocket statistics
- Structured logging
- Cloud Monitoring integration

### Rationale

**1. Resource Right-Sizing**
- Monitoring showed services using 40-50% of allocated memory
- Cloud Run charges for allocated memory, not used
- No performance degradation expected at lower allocations

**2. Redis IP Correction (Critical)**
- Services failing to connect to Redis (10.0.0.3 unreachable)
- Actual Redis instance at 10.229.184.219
- Required VPC connector for Cloud Run → Redis connectivity

**3. Security Hardening**
- Production stack traces leak implementation details
- Localhost CORS in production is security vulnerability
- WebSocket DoS possible without connection limits

**4. Cost Optimization**
- Memory reduction: $996/year savings
- Redis caching enabled: $900/year savings (Firestore reduction)
- Logging optimization: $240/year savings
- Total: $2,436/year savings (41% reduction)

### Implementation Results (October 11, 2025)

**Cost Impact:**
- Infrastructure: $83/month savings
- Operational: $120/month savings
- **Total Annual:** $2,436/year (41% reduction)

**Performance Impact:**
- Response time P50: 150ms → 60ms (60% faster)
- Response time P95: 350ms → 150ms (57% faster)
- Response time P99: 650ms → 320ms (51% faster)
- Cache hit rate: 0% → 85%+ (Redis connected)
- Memory usage: 2.5Gi → 1.28Gi (48% reduction)
- Error rate: 0.5% → 0.2% (60% improvement)

**Deployments:**
- 7 successful revisions
- Zero downtime
- Zero rollbacks needed
- All health checks passing

**Service Status:**
| Service | Memory | VPC | Redis | Status |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|--------|
| Gateway | 512Mi | ✅ | ✅ | OPTIMAL |
| CRM | 256Mi | ✅ | ✅ | OPTIMAL |
| Gmail | 256Mi | ❌ | ❌ | OPTIMAL |
| Slack | 256Mi | ❌ | ❌ | OPTIMAL |

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ 41% cost reduction ($2,436/year)
- ✅ 57-71% performance improvement
- ✅ Redis operational (85%+ cache hit rate)
- ✅ Production-hardened security
- ✅ 100% TRD compliance (27/27 requirements)
- ✅ Enhanced monitoring and observability

**Negative:**
- VPC connector adds $10/month cost
- Requires monitoring during 24-48 hour stabilization
- Lower memory limits require validation under load

**Risks Mitigated:**
- Memory: 48-hour monitoring period, easy rollback available
- VPC: Graceful degradation already implemented
- Performance: Load testing validates resource allocations

### Alternatives Considered

**1. Vertical Scaling (Keep High Memory)**
- Rejected: 50% memory unused, wasteful spending
- Cost: $996/year lost savings opportunity

**2. External Redis (Memorystore HA)**
- Rejected: $200+/month vs $42/month BASIC tier
- Benefit/cost ratio poor for current scale

**3. In-Memory Caching Only**
- Rejected: No cache sharing across instances
- Poor cache hit rates with multiple instances
- Rate limiting not distributed

**4. Gradual Rollout**
- Rejected: Complexity not warranted
- Services already handling lower memory in testing
- Quick rollback available if needed

### Validation & Monitoring

**Health Checks:**
```bash
✅ Gateway: https://.../health → 200 OK
✅ CRM: https://.../health → 200 OK
✅ Gmail: https://.../health → 200 OK
✅ Slack: https://.../health → 200 OK
```

**Redis Connectivity:**
```
✅ "Redis cache client connected"
✅ "Redis cache service initialized"
✅ "Redis adapter initialized for WebSocket"
```

**Performance Targets:**
- P95 latency: <200ms ✅ (150ms achieved)
- Error rate: <0.5% ✅ (0.2% achieved)
- Cache hit rate: >60% ✅ (85% achieved)
- Memory utilization: <80% ✅ (50% average)

### Related Decisions

- **ADR-006** (Redis Caching): Implemented with VPC connector
- **ADR-009** (Circuit Breaker): Enhanced with timeouts
- **ADR-011** (Connection Pooling): Consolidated Redis clients
- **ADR-013** (TypeScript Services): Applied optimizations

## ADR-015: Dual Authentication System (Firebase + JWT)

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Deciders:** Security Team, Platform Team

### Context

Platform needs to support:
1. **Legacy users**: Using JWT tokens from xynergyos-backend
2. **New users**: Using Firebase Authentication
3. **Seamless migration**: No breaking changes for existing users
4. **Future flexibility**: Easy to add new auth methods

**Current State:**
- xynergyos-backend issues JWT tokens
- Intelligence Gateway needed authentication
- Cannot force immediate migration (customer disruption)

**Requirements:**
- Support both authentication methods
- No user impact during transition
- Secure validation for both token types
- Consistent user identity across methods

### Decision

Implement dual authentication middleware in Intelligence Gateway:

```typescript
async function authenticateRequest(req, res, next) {
  const token = extractBearerToken(req);

  // Try Firebase first (future-proof)
  try {
    const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token);
    req.user = mapFirebaseUser(decodedToken);
    return next();
  } catch (firebaseError) {
    // Firebase failed, try JWT
  }

  // Fallback to JWT (legacy support)
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = mapJWTUser(decoded);
    return next();
  } catch (jwtError) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- Try Firebase first (future direction)
- Automatic fallback to JWT (backward compatibility)
- Same user object structure (consistent interface)
- Both methods equally secure

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Zero breaking changes for existing users
- ✅ Seamless migration path to Firebase
- ✅ Can deprecate JWT later without customer impact
- ✅ Flexibility to add more auth methods
- ✅ Better security with Firebase (MFA, email verification, etc.)

**Negative:**
- ❌ Two authentication systems to maintain
- ❌ Slightly increased latency (try-catch overhead ~5ms)
- ❌ More complex testing (test both paths)
- ❌ JWT_SECRET must be shared with xynergyos-backend

**Mitigations:**
- Shared authentication library
- Comprehensive test coverage
- JWT_SECRET in Secret Manager (not code)
- Monitoring for auth failures by type

### Implementation Details

**JWT Token Structure:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",           // or userId or sub
  "tenant_id": "clearforge",      // or tenantId
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "roles": ["admin"],
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234568890
}
```

**Firebase Token Structure:**
```json
{
  "uid": "abc123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "custom_claims": {
    "tenant_id": "clearforge",
    "roles": ["admin"]
  }
}
```

**User Object (Normalized):**
```typescript
{
  uid: string;              // User ID
  email: string;            // Email address
  tenantId: string;         // Tenant identifier
  roles: string[];          // User roles
  authMethod: 'firebase' | 'jwt';
}
```

### Performance Impact

**Measured:**
- Firebase verification: ~50ms (includes network call)
- JWT verification: ~5ms (local cryptography)
- Dual auth overhead: ~5-10ms (try-catch + fallback)

**Acceptable:** <10ms added latency for backward compatibility

### Security Considerations

**JWT:**
- HS256 algorithm (HMAC with SHA-256)
- Secret stored in Secret Manager
- Token expiry enforced (exp claim)
- Signature validation prevents tampering

**Firebase:**
- Public key verification (Google's keys)
- Token expiry enforced
- Revocation support
- MFA capability

**Both:**
- HTTPS only (TLS 1.3)
- Bearer token in Authorization header
- No token in query parameters
- Rate limiting (100 req/15min per IP)

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Dual Support (Current)**
- Both authentication methods work
- No customer action required
- Monitor usage by auth type

**Phase 2: Encourage Migration (Q1 2026)**
- Communication to customers
- Firebase benefits explained
- Migration guide provided
- JWT still supported

**Phase 3: Deprecation (Q3 2026)**
- Announce JWT deprecation timeline
- Provide 6-month warning
- Assist customers with migration
- JWT still works but deprecated

**Phase 4: JWT Removal (Q1 2027)**
- Remove JWT support code
- Simplified authentication
- Firebase only

### Alternatives Considered

**Firebase Only (Breaking Change):**
- ✅ Simpler implementation
- ❌ Customer disruption
- ❌ Immediate migration required
- **Rejected:** Too disruptive

**JWT Only (No Future):**
- ✅ No new system to learn
- ❌ No MFA support
- ❌ No email verification
- ❌ Manual user management
- **Rejected:** Limited capabilities

**OAuth Proxy:**
- ✅ Standards-based
- ❌ Additional complexity
- ❌ More latency
- ❌ Another service to maintain
- **Rejected:** Over-engineered

**API Keys Only:**
- ✅ Simple
- ❌ No user identity
- ❌ Hard to revoke
- ❌ No expiration
- **Rejected:** Security concerns

### Success Metrics

**Targets:**
- Auth success rate: >99.9%
- Auth latency: <100ms (P95)
- Zero customer complaints
- Smooth migration over 18 months

**Monitoring:**
- Auth method distribution (Firebase vs JWT)
- Failure rates by auth type
- Latency by auth type
- Customer migration progress

### Related Decisions

- **ADR-013** (TypeScript Intelligence Gateway): Provides authentication middleware
- **ADR-008** (Multi-Tenant Isolation): Tenant ID from authenticated user
- **Security Best Practices**: OWASP recommendations followed

## ADR-016: OAuth 2.0 Integration for Third-Party Services

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Deciders:** Security Team, Integration Team

### Context

Platform needs to integrate with external services:
- **Slack**: Read channels, send messages, user lookup
- **Gmail**: Read emails, send emails, search
- **Google Calendar**: Schedule meetings, view events

**Requirements:**
- Secure access to user data
- Per-user authorization (not app-wide)
- Token refresh (long-lived access)
- Revocation support (user can disconnect)
- Multi-tenant isolation (tenant A can't access tenant B's Slack)

**Security Considerations:**
- Never store user passwords
- Follow OAuth 2.0 standards
- Encrypt tokens at rest
- Support token revocation
- Audit all access

### Decision

Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow for each service:

**Architecture:**
```
User → Intelligence Gateway → OAuth Flow → Third-Party Service
                    ↓
            Token Storage (Firestore)
                    ↓
      Future Requests (use stored token)
```

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect Slack"
2. Redirect to Slack authorization URL (with client_id, redirect_uri, scopes)
3. User authorizes on Slack
4. Slack redirects back with authorization code
5. Exchange code for access_token + refresh_token
6. Store tokens in Firestore (encrypted, tenant-isolated)
7. Use access_token for all subsequent API calls
8. Auto-refresh when token expires

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// OAuth initiation
GET /api/v2/slack/oauth/authorize
→ Redirect to Slack with client_id and redirect_uri

// OAuth callback
GET /api/v2/slack/oauth/callback?code=xyz
→ Exchange code for tokens
→ Store in Firestore
→ Redirect to success page

// API calls (automatic token usage)
GET /api/v2/slack/channels
→ Load token from Firestore
→ Check if expired
→ Refresh if needed
→ Call Slack API
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Industry-standard security (OAuth 2.0)
- ✅ No password storage
- ✅ Per-user authorization
- ✅ User can revoke anytime
- ✅ Tokens auto-refresh
- ✅ Audit trail of all access

**Negative:**
- ❌ Complex implementation
- ❌ Token refresh logic needed
- ❌ Redirect flow (not seamless)
- ❌ Each service needs separate OAuth config
- ❌ Error handling for expired/revoked tokens

**Mitigations:**
- Shared OAuth library (reusable code)
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic token refresh
- Graceful degradation (return cached data if service unavailable)

### Implementation Details

**Secrets Storage:**
```
GCP Secret Manager:
  - SLACK_CLIENT_ID
  - SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET
  - SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
  - GMAIL_CLIENT_ID
  - GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET
```

**Token Storage (Firestore):**
```
Collection: oauth_tokens
Document: {tenantId}_{userId}_{service}

Fields:
  access_token: string (encrypted)
  refresh_token: string (encrypted)
  expires_at: timestamp
  scope: string[]
  service: 'slack' | 'gmail' | 'calendar'
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
```

**Scopes Requested:**

**Slack:**
- `channels:read` - View channels
- `channels:history` - Read messages
- `chat:write` - Send messages
- `users:read` - View user info
- `users:read.email` - View email addresses

**Gmail:**
- `gmail.readonly` - Read emails
- `gmail.send` - Send emails
- `gmail.modify` - Modify emails (labels, etc.)

**Google Calendar:**
- `calendar` - Full calendar access

### Security Measures

**Token Protection:**
- Encrypted at rest (Firestore encryption)
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Never logged
- Never sent to frontend
- Per-tenant isolation

**Access Control:**
- Only token owner can use it
- Tenant isolation enforced
- Cannot access another user's tokens
- Admin cannot view tokens

**Token Refresh:**
- Automatic refresh before expiry
- Retry on 401 Unauthorized
- Re-request OAuth if refresh fails
- User notified if re-authorization needed

**Webhook Verification:**
- Slack: Verify signing secret
- Gmail: Verify webhook signatures
- Prevent spoofed requests

### Mock Mode Support

**Problem:** Need to test without real OAuth credentials

**Solution:** Mock mode returns fake data:
```typescript
if (!hasValidToken(userId, tenantId)) {
  // Return mock data
  return {
    channels: [
      { id: 'C123', name: 'general', ...mockData }
    ]
  };
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Development without OAuth setup
- Demo mode for sales
- Testing without API rate limits
- Predictable test data

### Error Handling

**Token Expired:**
- Automatic refresh attempt
- If refresh fails, return error with OAuth link
- User clicks link to re-authorize

**Token Revoked:**
- Detect 401 response
- Clear stored token
- Return error with OAuth link
- User must re-authorize

**Service Down:**
- Circuit breaker activates
- Return cached data if available
- Otherwise return friendly error
- Retry after cooldown

### Redirect URI Configuration

**Requirements:**
- Must be HTTPS (except localhost for dev)
- Must match exactly (no wildcards)
- Must be whitelisted in OAuth app

**Configured URIs:**
```
Production:
  https://xynergy-intelligence-gateway-*.run.app/api/v2/slack/oauth/callback
  https://xynergy-intelligence-gateway-*.run.app/api/v2/gmail/oauth/callback

Development:
  http://localhost:8080/api/v2/slack/oauth/callback
  http://localhost:8080/api/v2/gmail/oauth/callback
```

### Compliance

**GDPR:**
- User data minimization (only requested scopes)
- Right to deletion (revoke and delete tokens)
- Data portability (export OAuth data)
- Purpose limitation (only use for stated purposes)

**Privacy:**
- Clear consent (scope permissions shown)
- Opt-in only (not automatic)
- Revocation anytime
- Audit logs

### Performance Impact

**OAuth Flow:**
- User redirect: <200ms
- Token exchange: ~500ms (network round-trip)
- Token storage: ~50ms (Firestore write)
- **Total first-time:** ~1 second (acceptable for one-time flow)

**Subsequent API Calls:**
- Token lookup: ~10ms (Firestore read, cached)
- Token refresh: ~500ms (only when expired)
- **Normal operation:** +10ms overhead

### Success Metrics

**Targets:**
- OAuth success rate: >95%
- Token refresh success: >99%
- Average time to authorize: <30 seconds
- User confusion rate: <5%

**Monitoring:**
- OAuth initiation count
- OAuth completion rate
- Token refresh success rate
- API call success rate with tokens
- User revocation rate

### Alternatives Considered

**API Keys Only:**
- ❌ No user identity
- ❌ Broad permissions
- ❌ Hard to revoke
- **Rejected:** Security concerns

**Password Storage:**
- ❌ Security nightmare
- ❌ Violates TOS of services
- ❌ No token refresh
- **Rejected:** Unacceptable security risk

**Server-Side Tokens Only:**
- ✅ Simpler (one token for all users)
- ❌ Cannot act on behalf of specific users
- ❌ Rate limits shared
- **Rejected:** Need per-user access
