```python
# Check cache
cached_strategy = await redis_cache.get("campaign", cache_key)
if cached_strategy:
    campaign_strategy = cached_strategy  # Cache hit!
else:
    # Generate expensive AI content
    campaign_strategy = await generate_campaign_strategy(request)
    # Cache for reuse
    await redis_cache.set("campaign", cache_key, campaign_strategy, ttl=3600)
```

**analytics-data-layer** 🟢:
- Pattern documented
- Ready for implementation (same pattern as marketing-engine)

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Immediate Deployment (No Code Changes Needed)

#### Step 1: Deploy Cloud Run Resource Limits (15 minutes)
```bash
# Authenticate to GCP
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project xynergy-dev-1757909467

# Test dry-run first
./deploy-resource-limits.sh all yes

# Deploy for real
./deploy-resource-limits.sh all no

# Verify
for service in marketing-engine ai-assistant ai-routing-engine; do
  gcloud run services describe xynergy-$service --region=us-central1 \
    --format="value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.limits)"
done
```

**Expected Output**:
- All 27 services updated with resource limits
- Scale-to-zero enabled for Tier 1 services
- Immediate cost reduction visible in Cloud Run dashboard

#### Step 2: Configure Redis Connection (5 minutes)
```bash
# Set Redis host environment variable for services using cache
for service in marketing-engine analytics-data-layer; do
  gcloud run services update xynergy-$service \
    --update-env-vars REDIS_HOST=10.0.0.3 \
    --region=us-central1
done
```

#### Step 3: Verify Health Checks (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check all services are healthy with new configurations
./check-service-health.sh  # (script to create below)
```

## 📊 COST MONITORING

### Week 1 After Deployment
Monitor these metrics:

**Cloud Run Console**:
1. **Instance hours**: Should decrease 40-60% for Tier 1 services
2. **CPU utilization**: Should stay below 70%
3. **Memory utilization**: Should stay below 80%
4. **Request latency**: Should improve or stay same (better with HTTP/2)

**Redis Dashboard**:
1. **Cache hit rate**: Target >40% for marketing-engine
2. **Memory usage**: Should stay under 50% of allocated
3. **Connection count**: Stable (not growing)

**Cost Dashboard**:
```bash
# View Cloud Run costs
gcloud billing accounts list
gcloud beta billing budgets list --billing-account=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID

# Expected Week 1 savings: ~$600-900 (25% of monthly)
```

### Adjustments to Make
If services are struggling:
- **CPU throttling errors**: Increase CPU allocation by 0.5-1 vCPU
- **Memory exceeded**: Increase memory by 256Mi-512Mi
- **Cold start issues**: Increase min-instances by 1

If services are over-provisioned:
- **CPU usage <30%**: Decrease CPU by 0.5 vCPU
- **Memory usage <40%**: Decrease memory by 256Mi
- **Always idle**: Decrease max-instances
