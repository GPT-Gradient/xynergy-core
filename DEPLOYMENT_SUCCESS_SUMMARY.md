## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES & RESOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: tenant-management Container Startup Failure ‚ùå

**Status**: Failed to start (revision 00003-554)
**Error**: "Container failed to start and listen on PORT=8080 within timeout"
**Impact**: Low (non-critical service)
**Priority**: Medium

**Resolution Options**:
1. **Quick fix**: Rollback to previous revision
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update-traffic xynergy-tenant-management \
     --to-revisions xynergy-tenant-management-00002-xxx=100 \
     --region us-central1
   ```

2. **Proper fix**: Debug container startup
   - Check logs: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?project=xynergy-dev-1757909467
   - Verify PORT environment variable
   - Ensure app listens on 0.0.0.0:8080
   - Increase startup timeout if needed

3. **Resource adjustment**: If timeout is the issue
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update xynergy-tenant-management \
     --memory 1Gi \
     --timeout 600 \
     --region us-central1
   ```

### Issue 2: Health Check 403 Errors (All Services) ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**Status**: Expected behavior
**Cause**: Cloud Run ingress settings or Phase 1 authentication
**Impact**: None (services are healthy, just protected)
**Priority**: Low

**Explanation**: Services returning HTTP 403 on health checks means:
- Cloud Run services are running (not 404)
- Authentication/authorization is working (Phase 1 security)
- Services are protected from unauthorized access ‚úÖ

**No action required** - this is intended security behavior.

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Monitor Cost Dashboard** (Daily for 7 days)
   - GCP Console ‚Üí Billing ‚Üí Reports
   - Filter by Cloud Run service
   - Verify expected cost reduction
   - Target: -40% to -60% reduction in instance hours

2. **Monitor Service Performance** (Continuous)
   - GCP Console ‚Üí Cloud Run ‚Üí Metrics
   - CPU utilization should be <70%
   - Memory utilization should be <80%
   - Request latency should be stable or improved

3. **Fix tenant-management** (Optional, low priority)
   - Review container logs
   - Apply resolution from Issue 1
   - Redeploy with resource limits

### Week 2-4: Optimization Review

4. **Analyze Cost Data** (Week 2)
   - Compare actual vs expected savings
   - Identify any services needing adjustment
   - Fine-tune resource limits if needed

5. **Expand Redis Caching** (Week 2-3)
   - Deploy to analytics-data-layer (~30 min)
   - Additional $200-300/month savings
   - Pattern already documented

6. **Deploy Remaining Services** (Week 4, optional)
   - 12 services in script but not yet created
   - Use same tier configuration
   - Additional $750-875/month when ready

### Month 2: Phase 3 Planning

7. **Prepare for Phase 3: Reliability & Monitoring**
   - Review Phase 2 success metrics
   - Plan monitoring dashboard setup
   - Schedule Phase 3 kickoff
