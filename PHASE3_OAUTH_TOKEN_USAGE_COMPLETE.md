# Phase 3: OAuth Token Usage Fix - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Deployed
**Services Updated:** Slack Intelligence Service, Gmail Intelligence Service

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 successfully addressed the critical OAuth token usage architecture issue identified in the Frontend-Backend Compatibility Report. Previously, services used shared bot tokens accessible to all users (privacy and security issue). Now, services retrieve and use per-user OAuth tokens from Firestore, ensuring each user accesses only their own Slack and Gmail accounts.

**Key Achievement:** Services now properly use per-user OAuth tokens instead of shared bot tokens, fixing the privacy and security vulnerability.

---

## Problem Statement

**Before Phase 3:**
- Slack Intelligence Service used `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable (your personal bot token) as fallback for ALL users
- Gmail Intelligence Service had similar shared credential pattern
- Phase 2 (OAuth Management) stored per-user tokens in Firestore ✅
- BUT services didn't actually USE the per-user tokens ❌

**Security/Privacy Impact:**
- All users shared YOUR Slack/Gmail access
- Users could see each other's private messages and emails
- No proper user isolation

---

## Solution Implemented

### Architecture Changes

**✅ Per-User Token Retrieval:**
- Services now retrieve user-specific OAuth tokens from Firestore
- Token documents: `oauth_tokens/{userId}_slack`, `oauth_tokens/{userId}_gmail`
- Tokens are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Token expiry checks before use

**✅ Service Pattern:**
```typescript
// NEW: Get user-specific client
private async getUserClient(userId: string): Promise<WebClient> {
  // Retrieve from Firestore
  const tokenDoc = await this.firestore
    .collection('oauth_tokens')
    .doc(`${userId}_slack`)
    .get();

  if (!tokenDoc.exists) {
    throw new ServiceUnavailableError('Slack not connected. Please connect via Settings > Integrations.');
  }

  // Decrypt token
  const accessToken = this.decrypt(tokenData.accessToken);

  // Return user-specific client
  return new WebClient(accessToken);
}
```

**✅ All Methods Updated:**
- Every service method now accepts `userId` as first parameter
- Methods call `getUserClient(userId)` to get per-user authenticated client
- Clear error messages guide users to connect their accounts in Settings

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

1. **User Connects Account (Phase 2 - OAuth Management):**
   - User goes to Settings > Integrations
   - Clicks "Connect Slack" or "Connect Gmail"
   - OAuth flow redirects to Google/Slack authorization page
   - User authorizes access to their personal account
   - Token stored in Firestore: `oauth_tokens/{userId}_slack` (encrypted)

2. **User Makes API Request (Phase 3 - Token Usage):**
   - User makes authenticated request to gateway
   - Gateway forwards request to Slack/Gmail intelligence service
   - Service extracts `userId` from JWT token
   - Service retrieves user's personal OAuth token from Firestore
   - Service decrypts token
   - Service creates user-specific API client with decrypted token
   - Service makes API call to Slack/Gmail using user's personal token
   - Response returned to user

3. **Error Handling:**
   - **No token found:** "Slack/Gmail not connected. Please connect your account in Settings > Integrations."
   - **Token expired:** "Slack/Gmail token expired. Please reconnect your account in Settings > Integrations."
   - **API error:** Detailed error message with logging

## Security Improvements

### Before Phase 3
- ❌ Shared bot token in environment variable
- ❌ All users accessed same Slack workspace
- ❌ No user isolation
- ❌ Privacy violation

### After Phase 3
- ✅ Per-user OAuth tokens retrieved from Firestore
- ✅ Tokens encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- ✅ Each user accesses only their own Slack/Gmail account
- ✅ Full user isolation
- ✅ Token expiry checks
- ✅ Graceful error handling with user guidance

## Environment Variables

### What SHOULD Be Configured (App-level OAuth credentials)

**Slack:**
- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth app identifier (public)
- `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth app secret (private)
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` - Webhook verification

**Gmail:**
- `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth app identifier (public)
- `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth app secret (private)

**Token Encryption:**
- `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - 32-byte hex string for AES-256-GCM encryption

### What should NOT Be Configured (per-user tokens)

**❌ REMOVED:**
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - No longer used (was security issue)
- Individual Gmail credentials - Now per-user via OAuth

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

#### Slack Service
- [ ] User with no Slack connection gets clear error message
- [ ] User connects Slack via OAuth flow
- [ ] User can list their Slack channels (sees their own workspace)
- [ ] User can read messages from their channels
- [ ] User can post messages to their channels
- [ ] User can search their Slack workspace
- [ ] User can disconnect Slack
- [ ] Different users see different Slack workspaces (if multi-workspace)

#### Gmail Service
- [ ] User with no Gmail connection gets clear error message
- [ ] User connects Gmail via OAuth flow
- [ ] User can list their Gmail messages (sees their own emails)
- [ ] User can read their email details
- [ ] User can send emails from their account
- [ ] User can search their emails
- [ ] User can view email threads
- [ ] User can disconnect Gmail
- [ ] Different users see different Gmail accounts

#### Token Management
- [ ] OAuth tokens are encrypted in Firestore
- [ ] Tokens are properly decrypted when retrieved
- [ ] Expired tokens trigger reconnection prompt
- [ ] Token expiry is checked before API calls

---

## Mock Mode Behavior

Both services continue to support mock mode when OAuth credentials are not configured:

**Mock Mode Active When:**
- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` or `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` not set (Slack)
- `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` or `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` not set (Gmail)

**Mock Mode Behavior:**
- Returns simulated data for all endpoints
- Useful for development and testing
- Health checks report "mock" status
- No real API calls made

---

## Integration with Gateway

The Intelligence Gateway (`xynergyos-intelligence-gateway`) already correctly forwards authenticated requests to these services. No gateway changes were needed for Phase 3.

**Gateway Routes:**
- `/api/v2/slack/*` → Slack Intelligence Service
- `/api/v2/email/*` → Gmail Intelligence Service

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Frontend sends request with JWT token: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
2. Gateway validates JWT and extracts `userId`
3. Gateway forwards request to intelligence service with auth header
4. Intelligence service extracts `userId` from JWT
5. Intelligence service retrieves user's OAuth token from Firestore
6. Intelligence service makes API call with user's personal token

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Calendar Service:** Not updated in Phase 3 (not yet implemented)
2. **Token Refresh:** While tokenManager supports auto-refresh, services don't trigger refresh yet (returns error prompting reconnection)
3. **Health Checks:** Don't test per-user token validity (by design - health checks are public)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

Phase 4 will implement the Integrations Management endpoints to provide a unified interface for managing OAuth connections:

**Endpoints to Implement:**
- `GET /api/v1/integrations/list` - List user's connected services
- `GET /api/v1/integrations/available` - List available OAuth providers
- `POST /api/v1/integrations/connect` - Initiate OAuth flow
- `GET /api/v1/integrations/callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- `DELETE /api/v1/integrations/:id` - Disconnect service
- `POST /api/v1/integrations/sync/:provider` - Trigger data sync

This will unify OAuth management and provide better frontend integration.

2. ✅ Services use decrypted user tokens for API calls
3. ✅ Each user accesses only their own Slack/Gmail account
4. ✅ Clear error messages when user hasn't connected account
5. ✅ Token expiry checks implemented
6. ✅ Services deployed and running
